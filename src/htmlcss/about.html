		<h2> About Hacker Finder </h2>
		<p> Hacker Finder is here to make sure that students can attend hackathons and have the best experience there with the best team they can find. So many college students are deterred from attending hackathons just because they don't know about them or know anyone going. If they do end up deciding to go alone, they take a huge risk of traveling sometimes great distances to hope that they can find a good team at the hackathon itself. This should not be a gamble. That's why Hacker Finder was built, to be a one-stop shop for students' hackathon needs. They can view upcoming hackathons, find students attending them, and contact them. It eliminates the guesswork in finding a team, and makes sure they can have the best team to create the best hack. <br> <br> 

		The way it works is that each user has their own profile, full of information about their school and skills. Once you make a profile, you can go to a page where you can search through a list of hackathons coming up, finding all the essential information you need about it. Once you mark the ones you might want to go to, you can view more information about the hackathon itself, even with a link to the application page. There, you can also filter through a list of people attending to find people you may want to team up with! <br> <br> 

		Once you find someone you think you may like, you can message them through this website! Get to know them better as well as their skills and interests for the hackathon. You can even create groupchats as you add more people to your team. Once you found a team, Hacker Finder's job is done! Have fun at the hackathon, and come back to find you next hackathon and team.
